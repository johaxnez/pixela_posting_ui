# pixela_posting_ui

This is a UI i made for posting, updating and deleting to Pixela. I got the idea after finishing day 37 of 100 days of python. 
The UI is made using Tkinter. This was mostly done to practise and revisit concepts, as well as actually writing the code for something
i came up with, in stead of following a totorial. 
I have hidden my API key and username from the params dict. If you would like to use this code, you will need to make your own key.
